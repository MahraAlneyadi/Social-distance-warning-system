# Social-distance-warning-system
). This project mainly focuses on dealing with violations of social distance seats in public areas. The proposed system is expected to detect high tension on the blocked seat and alarm the violator. It consists of a force-sensitive resistance sensor connected to an Atmega328p microcontroller with 3 LEDs and a Buzzer to warn if any violation occurred. The system was first applied on Tinkercad and worked as expected with high performance and reliability. The future modification will be focusing on developing the design and expanding the use of the device to be operating in several cases. In addition, Following the constant changes in pandemic cases and preventive measures, there is a need for further system designs to limit ignorance and violations that affect the worldâ€™s recovery and human lives.
